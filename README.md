# Fake Credit Card Detection

## Overview
This Python script aims to detect fake credit card transactions using a logistic regression model. The project involves importing a credit card dataset, exploring its characteristics, and implementing a logistic regression model for fraud detection.


## Introduction
Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions can lead to significant financial losses. This project utilizes a logistic regression model to identify potentially fake transactions. The dataset is first explored, and then a logistic regression model is trained using under-sampling to balance the classes.


## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is named `creditcard.csv`. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud 

## Implementation
The script is implemented in Python and uses the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. It involves loading the dataset, exploring its characteristics, under-sampling for class balance, and training a logistic regression model.

## Results
The accuracy of the logistic regression model is evaluated on both the training and test datasets. Results can be found in the console output when running the script.
