## Introduction
Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions can lead to significant financial losses. This project utilizes a logistic regression model to identify potentially fake transactions. The dataset is first explored, and then a logistic regression model is trained using under-sampling to balance the classes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-credit-card-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fake_credit_card_detection.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is named `creditcard.csv`. You can find it [here](link-to-dataset).

## Implementation
The script is implemented in Python and uses the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` libraries. It involves loading the dataset, exploring its characteristics, under-sampling for class balance, and training a logistic regression model.

## Results
The accuracy of the logistic regression model is evaluated on both the training and test datasets. Results can be found in the console output when running the script.
